# 🏏 QuickCourt

**A local sports booking platform for customers, facility owners, and admins — built as a fast, scalable MVP for Odoo Hackathon 2025.**

## 📖 Project Overview

QuickCourt enables users to **discover sports venues, check real-time court availability, and book instantly** — all from a mobile-friendly interface. Facility owners can manage their venues, while admins keep the platform safe and growing.

-  **Customer** — Search, book, and manage sports court reservations.  
-  **Facility Owner** — Create and manage venues, courts, and schedules.  
-  **Admin** — Approve venues, view analytics, and moderate content.

**🎯 Design Goals:**  
-  Zero double-bookings (transaction-safe)  
-  Fast, intuitive booking flow  
-  Mobile-first design for on-the-go users  
-  Extendable for ERP/Odoo integration

## 🔄 Booking Flow

1.  Customer selects venue & court → chooses slot  
2.  Frontend sends booking request to backend  
3.  Backend:  
   -  Starts transaction  
   -  Inserts booking with `tstzrange` constraint  
   -  Confirms booking if slot available; ❌ rejects with 409 otherwise  
4.  Payment processed (simulated)  
5.  Owners get notified via dashboard (WebSocket/polling)
