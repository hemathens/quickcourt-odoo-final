# QuickCourt

**A local sports booking platform for customers, facility owners, and admins — built as a fast, scalable MVP for Odoo Hackathon 2025.**

---

## Project Overview

QuickCourt enables users to **discover sports venues, check real-time court availability, and book instantly** — all from a mobile-friendly interface. Facility owners can manage their venues, while admins keep the platform safe and growing.

**User Roles:**  
- **Customer** — Search, book, and manage sports court reservations.  
- **Facility Owner** — Create and manage venues, courts, and schedules.  
- **Admin** — Approve venues, view analytics, and moderate content.

**Design Goals:**  
- Zero double-bookings (transaction-safe).
- Fast, intuitive booking flow.
- Mobile-first design for on-the-go users.
- Extendable for ERP/Odoo integration.

## Booking Flow

1. Customer selects venue & court → chooses slot.
2. Frontend sends booking request to backend.
3. Backend:
   - Starts transaction.
   - Inserts booking with `tstzrange` constraint.
   - Confirms booking if slot available; otherwise, rejects with 409.
4. Payment processed (simulated).
5. Owners get notified via dashboard (WebSocket/polling).
